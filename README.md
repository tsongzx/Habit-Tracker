# Habit Tracker
Written in JavaScript, CSS and HTML. This is a combined calendar and goal tracker. It allows the user to enter in goals and cross them out on the days which the user has finished the goals. Also provides a look on which days in a month a certain goal has been completed, giving the user a better understanding of how consistent they are with their habits.
